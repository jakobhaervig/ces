The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid presents challenges due to the lack of inertia, leading to fast frequency deviation problems. Black start capability is lost due to decommissioning of large synchronous generators. This paper explores the black start capability of a hybrid power plant (HPP) combining onshore wind and solar PV power with battery energy storage systems (BESS) using grid-forming (GFM) control.
The study focuses on a simplified model of Eurowindâ€™s Greenlab site in Denmark, which includes 53.85 MW of wind power and 30.8 MW of solar power. For this study, a large energy storage battery is added to act as a BESS and GFM, enabling black start services. The methodology involves modelling the hybrid power plant, designing the energy storage system, and developing strategies for energising the plant and local grid without external support. Key tasks include synchronisation of wind turbines, PV units, and BESS with voltage and frequency regulation, and re-energising the local grid. This research aims to contribute to the development of resilient power systems capable of supporting black start operations in a renewable energy-dominated grid.
