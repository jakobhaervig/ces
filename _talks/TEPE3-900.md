This report presents the modeling of a 1 MW high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel
cell (HT-PEMFC) system for LNG-powered marine vessels. The system
utilizes methane from the LNG tank, which undergoes methane steam
reforming followed by a water-gas shift reaction to produce hydrogen
required for the fuel cell. The main goal is to simulate the system
using Aspen Plus to study its performance based on important operational
parameters. The results from the simulation will be compared with
experimental data from the literature to check the accuracy of the
model. A pinch analysis was also carried out to look at possible ways to
improve heat integration, using the waste heat generated by the
HT-PEMFC, which operates at 150C. This waste heat can be used to
support a carbon capture process, which could help increase energy
efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. The results show that
integrating HT-PEMFC systems into marine vessels has strong potential
for making transportation more energy-efficient and environmentally
friendly. By integrating it with carbon capture unit, carbon emissions
from the vessels can be significantly reduced.
