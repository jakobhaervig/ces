CO<sub>2</sub> plays a significant role in global warming.
The removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, to mitigate global warming are necessary to reduce the climate consequences.
Energy conservation and momentum conservation laws works on all scales, and light carries momentum and energy. 
In this study the exchange of forces on the molecular level is investigated in a CCUS context.
It is found that the effect is minor, however it is easily controlled and has resulted in a possible source term for CFD simulations.
The induced concentration gradient is significant enough to overcome the baseline kinetics of ideal gases at standard conditions, resulting in a clear effect on the separation of CO<sub>2</sub> from ambient air. This effect is comparable, in energy efficiency to other technologies.
Our result demonstrates it is possible to work directly on single molecules in a gas with ordered work instead of heat, leading to a significant reduction in entropy generation.
It is anticipated that this will lead to further developments in separation of low concentration chemical species from gases using comparable techniques.
