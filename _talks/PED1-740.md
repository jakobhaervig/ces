To reduce CO2 emissions, fuel-based power plants are gradually being replaced by renewable energy sources, and wind power is currently a significant contributor to this transition. When wind turbines are connected to the grid, the interactions between the generator-side and grid-side dynamics pose an engineering challenge, in ensuring a safe and stable operation. Additionally, modern wind turbines are subjected to a set of grid codes related to power quality and low-voltage-ride-through capabilities. For these reasons, a controllable back-to-back converter system that completely or partially separates the turbine and the grid can be used, and it is important to investigate how this converter is modelled and controlled to fulfill the operational requirements. 

This project seeks to implement a back-to-back converter system for a wind turbine utilizing a doubly-fed induction generator, to design its control structure, to study its characteristics, and to optimize it to comply with the grid codes. This project plans to explore the operation of the back-to-back converter through simulation and experiments. In this way, the project aims to reinforce the existing knowledge in the important topic of integration of new energy technologies into the existing energy system.
