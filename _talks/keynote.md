Simulating physical phenomena in real-world applications poses significant challenges. However, leveraging the right computational tools can enable efficient and accurate modelling. In this keynote presentation, I will present my approach to solving complex, coupled systems, with a focus on the numerical methods employed. Specifically, I will present a MATLAB-based solver I've developed, designed to allow users to input equations in a flexible, EES-like manner (where expressions can be defined interchangeably on the left- or right-hand side). The solver utilizes symbolic mathematics to automatically linearize these equations and assemble them into large sparse matrices, enabling rapid convergence even for intricate coupled systems. Additionally, I will explore the application of linear programming techniques to optimize such systems effectively.
Beyond model development, ensuring usability through an intuitive interface is equally crucial. I will showcase the PureSim platform, an online tool Iâ€™ve initiated at Alfa Laval, where users can interact with these models directly in their web browser. This approach leverages modern web technologies, and I will demonstrate the strategies and methodologies employed to create a seamless user experience.
