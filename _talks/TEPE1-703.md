Heat transfer in pipes using liquid metals poses challenges due to the low Prandtl number of these fluids, rendering traditional Nusselt number correlations ineffective. Several empirical correlations have been developed for liquid metals, but their predictions vary significantly, and the most accurate correlation remains uncertain. This study compares various Nusselt number correlations with CFD simulations of fully developed pipe flow for a broad range of Reynolds, Prandtl, and Peclet numbers, aiming to identify the most accurate correlations. Previous studies have made limited comparisons of correlations in the turbulent region for full-pipe simulations under specific conditions. In this study, a unit cell approach with cyclic conditions in CFD is used to determine the Nusselt number, avoiding the need to simulate the entire pipe and aiming to produce a generalized dimensionless temperature profile. This research enhances the accuracy of Nusselt number predictions for liquid metals, improving the understanding of heat transfer mechanisms in high-performance systems. These insights can lead to more efficient thermal control and the development of more effective heat exchangers, contributing to more reliable industrial operations in applications utilizing liquid metals.
