The electricity market dynamics are influenced by the fluctuating nature of renewable energy sources, as the electricity prices are set according to the expected energy supply and demand. In Denmark, the demand-side management strategies are primarily focused on shifting the consumption to off-peak periods due to the electricity prices. However, the introduction of Power-to-X (PtX) as well as the combined demand from residential electric vehicles and large industrial consumers during off-peak periods can lead to congestion and increased stress of the grid. In order to study the flexibility of the grid, a case study is performed using a simulation-based approach and the theoretical results are compared to a real-time simulation. Here, different grid scenarios including photovoltaics, wind turbines, PtX, batteries and electrical vehicles are studied, and the grid conditions are assessed through grid readiness metrics. Through this, the challenges faced when integrating renewable energy are studied. By evaluating grid readiness, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the impact the demand-side management will have in the current energy distribution grid. This is necessary when studying the future strengthening of the grid to increase the grid flexibility and reduce the stress on local distribution lines.
