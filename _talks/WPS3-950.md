The aim of this project is to use Model Predictive
Control (MPC) as an optimisation algorithm for
an Energy Management System (EMS) for a
household. The MPC is tested and compared to
a conventional Rule Based (RB) control. The tested
EMS manages a small wind turbine, PV panels, a
battery stack, household loads (including EV) and a
grid connection while taking into account weather
forecasts as well as electricity buying and selling
prices scheduled a day ahead. The focus of the
EMS is to minimize costs, while keeping stress on the
batteries as low as possible and thereby increase the lifetime.
The project is designed using Matlab Simulink and
validated with real measurement data.
