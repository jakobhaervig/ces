The 400 kV Trige-Kassø transmission line will be renovated and constructed as a hybrid cable-overhead line.
When energising a transmission line switching transients will occur, these transients cause fluctuation in current and voltage.
These fluctuations can affect equipment and needs to be analysed thoroughly in advance.
To address this problem, EMT simulation software is utilised to construct a system model and to determine the transient behaviour which is necessary as transients are key design parameters in power systems.
The purpose of this paper is to determine the severity of the transients of the Trige-Kassø transmission line and whether or not they cause problems. 
This paper lays groundwork for conducting further studies on the Trige-Kassø connection, studies such as insulation coordination, protection system design, fault analysis, harmonics and power quality and equipment ratings.
