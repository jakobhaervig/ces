The pitch system in a wind turbine is essential for optimizing performance and reducing downtime in the system. A HIL Test bench used in a larger HyRel project was the center of this project. Using a real-time SimuLink (Speedgoat) setup two cylinders could be controlled. This meant that one of the cylinders was used as a load, simulating the forces of the blade and, the other cylinder the actual pitch system. The objective was to develop different controllers using both linear and nonlinear control strategies. Using this system the load cylinder was to track a reference force and supply it onto the pitch cylinder to replicate a real-life scenario with the hydraulic system. This was done with multiple control strategies to get a broader understanding of the pitch system and its reliability. The pitch cylinder adjusted the pitch angle while countering the forces from the load cylinder. With these findings, it should be possible to improve the pitch system reliability and performance, while also reducing downtime for the wind turbine. As maintenance on wind turbines is a large expense the potential savings with an improved pitch system could be substantial.
