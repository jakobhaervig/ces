Vortex generators (VG) are geometries that separate the fluid encountering them. VGs are used in systems in order to delay fluid seperation, which reduces drag and improves heat exchange. Overall, this can improve sustainability and the economics of a system. Previous studies show that VGs reduce drag on vehicles, improves power output on wind turbines and have efficient heat transfer usage.
The main scope of this project is to develop a CFD model of a rectangular winglet pair in a Common flow up (CF-u) and Common flow down (CF-d) configuration. Done by accurately integrating velocities, pressures, and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to predict particle flow, and be experimentally validated using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) by tracing illuminated particles. 
The comparison of CFD results from ANSYS Fluent with AAU flow lab data will validate the CFD model, enabling further development of vortex generators. This will allow exploration of different shapes and sizes for various purposes without the need for physical prototypes.
