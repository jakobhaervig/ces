Energinet, the transmission system operator in Denmark, has identified premature failures in composite insulators used in high-voltage transmission systems. These modern insulators, designed to replace traditional glass insulators, are showing signs of degradation within the first 10 years of installation, especially in coastal areas with heavy salt contamination. This represents a significant problem, as glass insulators have historically demonstrated a lifespan of up to 50 years under similar conditions. The research is being conducted to understand the behavior of composite insulators under Denmark's specific climate conditions, characterized by high humidity and salt contamination, which accelerate their aging and affect the reliability of the transmission system. The study includes a literature review on the service performance of composite insulators in comparison to glass insulators. Additionally, a finite element method (FEM) model will be used to analyze the behavior of a composite insulator exposed to contamination and humidity. Laboratory tests will be conducted to validate performance under simulated accelerated aging conditions. The laboratory results will be used to extrapolate the long-term behavior of the insulators in environments with salt contamination.
