An increasing demand for irrigation in developing countries lead to a push for renewable energy pumping systems. A lack of continuous power supply for remote areas gives rise to alternative methods of pumping water.  Following UNs goals, the energy should stem from renewable sources of which PV-power is one. Current PV-pumping solutions lack a metric of which comparison can be based upon. In this project such a system is designed and sized to calculate the levelized cost of water from where comparison is possible. From industry and academia, the focus has been the efficiency of different components within the system, while only some has presented the economics behind the design decisions. The sizing of the systems has no dependence on the specific application profile where this paper takes the exact irrigation needs into account. From this, farmers could be benefited by this work comparing the levelized cost of water with other options available as well as pumping systems tailored to their exact needs. By implementing and spreading this system to remote areas in developing countries food security along with a reduction of poverty can be achieved as a direct result of the increased yield in crop production.
