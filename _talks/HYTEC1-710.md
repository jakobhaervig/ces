Heating consumption varies throughout the year, since in the winter the thermal and electrical energy generation does not always align, leading to a challenge for the Danish district heating system.
Thermal energy storage (TES) systems are a promising solution for stabilizing the grid and balancing fluctuating heating demands during colder months. 
One type of TES is based on latent heat “storage/transfer” which involves encapsulated Phase Change Materials (PCMs) for absorbing and releasing heat. 
This project showed the optimal geometry layout for capsules to increase the heat transfer coefficient between water and PCMs. 
The study found that, among the various models tested, the X layout, with a heat transfer coefficient of X W/m²K, a water flow rate of X m³/s, and X hours of energy storage, provided the best results. 
Therefore, from the perspective of an energy storage system, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been used for determining the heat transfer coefficient. 
Furthermore, the results have been validated through laboratory experiments to ensure reliability. 
Our findings demonstrate that... leading to improved overall performance of thermal energy storage systems.
